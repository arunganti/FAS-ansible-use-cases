Use Case 04: Enable/Disable pool member
=======================================
 
Prerequisites
-------------

This usecase assumes that a F5 BIG-IP instance, webservers and Ansible node are deployed. 
To deploy infrastructure in AWS users can use the `F5 Ansible Provisioner <https://github.com/f5alliances/f5_provisioner>`__


Overview of Use Case
--------------------

This use case will configure the BIG-IP To Enable or Disable LTM PoolMembers.

There are times where servers must be taken offline to provide upgrades,troubleshooting, or even replacement. This script allows the ability to
enable or disable members within a pool. This playbook allows the ability to enable/disable all pool members (all) or by host name
(e.g.Â host1:80)

.. note::

   There is an addtional extra_var within the playbook call to trigger the enable or disable

      # To Disable Pool Members
      ansible-playbook F5-LTM-Member-Enable-Disable.yaml -e @f5_vars.yml -e "pool_action=disable"
   
3. Testing and Validating
